        I love coding! Creating something to solve a problem is very satisfying.
        Seeing what I can do is very fun. <br />
        <br />I've also done coding to create games back when I initally wanted
        to become a game developer, of which I've shared
        <a href="https://mioluna.itch.io/" target="_blank">here</a>!

        I've always loved art. I've been drawing ever since I was little to cope
        with stress and to get some of my creative energy out. <br />
        Here's a character I've designed:

      <p>
        Games have been a huge part of my life and how computers intrigued me
        when I was young. My interest then grew into a career I wanted for
        myself. I still love to play games in my free time, with friends or
        alone!
